<h2>About Me</h2>
I'm a Senior Software Engineer with 5+ years experience working both independently and leading teams for medium sized businesses. My technical skills come with a strong operations background from a fast-paced environment. This has made me highly technical, detail-oriented, and expeditious. I now apply this to mobile and desktop software development. I'm currently learning how to develop my own neural network. Please contact me at snb1582@gmail.com for inquiries.

<h2> Projects I've Built Independently</h2>

<h3><strong><span style="color: #2a9d8f; text-decoration: underline;">Saloo Greetings</span></strong></h3>
<a href="https://github.com/samuelblack11/Saloo">GitHub Repository</a> | 
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/saloo-greetings/id6450127182">Live App</a> <br>
Skills Used: Swift, Python, Flask, and Azure<br><br>
    
Saloo is a private social network for connecting with loved ones, sharing memories, and celebrating special events.

Saloo combines 4 elements to create a unique greeting card experience:
1. Photography: Choose the ‚Äúcover‚Äù for your card. This will be a high quality photograph from Unsplash, the internet‚Äôs source for visuals. Saloo has curated the best options for each holiday and special occasion.
2. Photo Collage: Select up to 4 photos from your library or camera to include in your greeting card
3. Message: Write a message to your recipient
4. Song (optional but encouraged): Know your recipient‚Äôs favorite song? Have one in mind for your occasion? Connect your Apple Music (SM) subscription with the click of a button and select a song to play when the card is opened. If your recipient doesn't subscribe to Apple Music, we'll default to a preview of the song. Spotify functionality is coming soon!

While other social networking platforms share to your wider community, Saloo focuses on sharing greetings between individuals and small groups of people that you specify for each card. The convenience, privacy, and scope of custom options make for a wonderful greeting card experience. Please #SaySaloo and send a loved one a new kind of greeting today.

<h3><strong><span style="color: #2a9d8f; text-decoration: underline;">Proofed (work in progress)</span></strong></h3>
<a href="https://github.com/samuelblack11/Proofed">GitHub Repository</a> | 
<a href="https://proofed.azurewebsites.net">Live App</a> <br>
Skills Used: Node, Express, React, Azure<br><br>

Proofed is a proofreading application which allows users to easily spell check documents using the Bing Spell Check API. It has been optimized for both desktop and mobile. Please note that this project is shared here to demonstrate my competencies with the languages and technologies, rather than as a practical tool that should be used for large documents. This is because there is a low API limit applied to the app. If you would like to test the app's functionality, please do so with documents containing only a few paragraphs.
