<h2>Supply Chain Innovation & Full Stack Engineering with Sam</h2>

Driven by a sense of urgency and continuous learning, I combine full stack software engineering with a strong foundation in supply chain analytics. My passion for technological trends has fueled my dynamic journey across these fields over the past five years, applying cutting-edge techniques both professionally and in personal projects.

I'm a Senior Manager of Supply Chain Analytics with 5+ years of experience working independently and leading teams for medium-sized businesses. My strong operations background in fast-paced environments has honed my technical and analytical skills, making me highly detail-oriented and efficient in problem-solving. Outside of my professional role, I apply my expertise to full stack software development for mobile and desktop applications, continuously learning and experimenting with new technologies in passion projects like those listed below. Feel free to message me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-black-26046343/">LinkedIn</a>  to learn more or explore opportunities to collaborate.

<a href="https://github.com/samuelblack11/Saloo">GitHub Repository</a>
Skills Used: Swift, JavaScript, Node.js, and Azure<br><br>
    
Saloo is a private social network for connecting with loved ones, sharing memories, and celebrating special events.

Saloo combines 4 elements to create a unique greeting card experience:
1. Photography: Choose the ‚Äúcover‚Äù for your card. This will be a high quality photograph from Unsplash, the internet‚Äôs source for visuals. Saloo has curated the best options for each holiday and special occasion.
2. Photo Collage: Select up to 4 photos from your library or camera to include in your greeting card
3. Message: Write a message to your recipient
4. Song (optional but encouraged): Know your recipient‚Äôs favorite song? Have one in mind for your occasion? Connect your Apple Music (SM) subscription with the click of a button and select a song to play when the card is opened. If your recipient doesn't subscribe to Apple Music, we'll default to a preview of the song. Spotify functionality is coming soon!

While other social networking platforms share to your wider community, Saloo focuses on sharing greetings between individuals and small groups of people that you specify for each card. The convenience, privacy, and scope of custom options make for a wonderful greeting card experience. Please #SaySaloo and send a loved one a new kind of greeting today.
