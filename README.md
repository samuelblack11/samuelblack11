<h2>About Me</h2>
I'm a Senior Software Engineer with 5+ years experience working both independently and leading teams for medium sized businesses. My technical skills come with a strong operations background from a fast-paced environment. This has made me highly technical, detail-oriented, and expeditious. I now apply this to mobile and desktop software development. I'm currently learning how to develop my own neural network. Please contact me at snb1582@gmail.com for inquiries.

<h3><strong><span style="color: #2a9d8f; text-decoration: underline;">Saloo Greetings</span></strong></h3>
<a href="https://github.com/samuelblack11/Saloo">GitHub Repository</a> | 
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/saloo-greetings/id6476240440">Live App</a> <br>
Skills Used: Swift, JavaScript, Node.js, and Azure<br><br>
    
Saloo is a private social network for connecting with loved ones, sharing memories, and celebrating special events.

Saloo combines 4 elements to create a unique greeting card experience:
1. Photography: Choose the ‚Äúcover‚Äù for your card. This will be a high quality photograph from Unsplash, the internet‚Äôs source for visuals. Saloo has curated the best options for each holiday and special occasion.
2. Photo Collage: Select up to 4 photos from your library or camera to include in your greeting card
3. Message: Write a message to your recipient
4. Song (optional but encouraged): Know your recipient‚Äôs favorite song? Have one in mind for your occasion? Connect your Apple Music (SM) subscription with the click of a button and select a song to play when the card is opened. If your recipient doesn't subscribe to Apple Music, we'll default to a preview of the song. Spotify functionality is coming soon!

While other social networking platforms share to your wider community, Saloo focuses on sharing greetings between individuals and small groups of people that you specify for each card. The convenience, privacy, and scope of custom options make for a wonderful greeting card experience. Please #SaySaloo and send a loved one a new kind of greeting today.

<h3><strong><span style="color: #2a9d8f; text-decoration: underline;">FleetWare (work in progress)</span></strong></h3> <br>
<a href="https://github.com/samuelblack11/FleetWare">GitHub Repository</a>
Skills Used: Node.js, Express.js, React.js, MongoDB<br><br>

Fleetware is an innovative fleet management and route optimization tool designed for the modern logistics industry. Utilizing MERN stack technology (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), Fleetware will provide real-time tracking, efficient route planning, load optimization, and comprehensive fleet analytics. The tool will dynamically incorporate traffic, weather, and various logistical variables to optimize routes, ensuring timely deliveries and cost savings. The platform is scalable, catering to diverse business sizes, from small local fleets to large multinational logistics operations. Fleetware will stand out for its integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, constantly evolving to meet the complex demands of modern transportation challenges. This project is not just a showcase of technical proficiency, but a testament to practical, impactful solutions in the logistics sector. Please note that this project is a work in progress.

<h3><strong><span style="color: #2a9d8f; text-decoration: underline;">Proofed</span></strong></h3>
<a href="https://github.com/samuelblack11/Proofed">GitHub Repository</a> | 
<a href="https://proofed.azurewebsites.net">Live App</a> <br>
Skills Used: Node, Express, React, Azure<br><br>

Proofed is a basic proofreading application which allows users to easily spell check documents using the Bing Spell Check API. It has been optimized for both desktop and mobile. Please note that this project is shared here to demonstrate my competencies with the languages and technologies, rather than as a practical tool that should be used for large documents. This is because there is a low API limit applied to the app. If you would like to test the app's functionality, please do so with documents containing only a few paragraphs.
